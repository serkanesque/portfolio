	<small>To provide a comprehensive resource for the core audiences of charities, campaigners and practitioners.

	<small><b>The process</b></small>
</div>
<div grid-col="8" grid-pad="2" class="">
	<small>Being my first foray into the chairty space, I was unfamiliar with the role of trusts and how they differeed from traditional charitable oragnisations. To gain this knowledge I interviewed key stakeholders to gain an understadning not only of the trust's work but also the important distinctions between their work and the charities they support. This knowledge would later inform the site I/A, wireframing and UI. 	
	<ul>
	<li>The site should be less about the Trust themselves but highlight the positive effects its grant programmes have on the people who they support.</li>
	<li>The trust does not solict funds or accept applications for grants.</li>
	<li>To highlight the various sectors they support.</li>
	<li>To be a rescource for existing grantholders and provide them with the reporting materials they require.</li>
</ul>

	<small><b>The solution</b></small>
</div>
<div grid-col="8" grid-pad="2" class="">
	<small>
		The resulting site puts the people the Trust supports front and centre with the ability for users to search the extensive amount of charities the Trust supports. The UI conveys the identity of a trusted organisation with a human touch distinct from charitable organisations that are at the coal face of giving support for those in need.
